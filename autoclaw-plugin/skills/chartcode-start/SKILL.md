# Bootstrap Knowledge Graph

Run these steps in order:

1. **Bootstrap** (indexes all code with tree-sitter, 0 LLM tokens):
   ```bash
   chartcode init
   ```

2. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   chartcode stats
   ```

3. Report the results to the user: nodes, edges, rule files generated.

That's it. The `init` command does bootstrap + sync-rules automatically.
If `chartcode` is not found, try: `~/.chartcode/bin/chartcode init` or run the setup script: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.sh"`
